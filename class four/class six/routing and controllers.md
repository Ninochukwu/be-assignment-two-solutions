### **1. Purpose of Routing in Express.js and Difference from Controllers**

#### ✅ **Routing in Express.js:**

**Purpose:**
Routing is how Express **defines how the application responds** to client requests for a specific endpoint (path + HTTP method).

* Each route matches a **path and HTTP verb** (GET, POST, etc.)
* It's like the "traffic controller" directing requests to the correct logic.

#### ✅ **Controllers:**

**Purpose:**
Controllers are **functions that contain the business logic** — what should happen when a certain route is hit.

**Example:**


**Difference:**

| Aspect        | Routing                      | Controller                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Role          | Directs request to a handler | Handles the request logic     |
| Functionality | Defines URL + method         | Implements the business logic |
| Location      | In route files               | In separate controller files  |

### **2. Purpose of Separating Routes and Controllers**

**Benefits:**

1. **Clean Code Separation (Separation of Concerns):**

   * Routes handle request paths.
   * Controllers handle logic.
   * Easier to read and maintain.

2. **Reusability:**

   * Controllers can be reused in different routes if needed.

3. **Scalability:**

   * As the project grows, separating concerns helps organize complex logic.

4. **Testing:**

   * You can easily test controllers in isolation from routing.

5. **Team Collaboration:**

   * Backend teams can work on controller logic independently from those defining routes.
