# 1. Explain the difference between `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` array methods. Provide examples of when to use each.
2. What does the `reduce` method do and how would you use it to calculate the sum of an array?
3. Compare `some()` and `every()` methods. What do they return and when would you use each?


### 1. **`orEach vs map vs filter`**

* **`forEach`**: Runs a function for each item, but doesn't return anything. Use it to do things like print or update.


* **`map`**: Changes each item and returns a new array

* **`filter`**: Keeps only items that pass a test, and returns a new array.


### 2. **`reduce`**

* Combines all items into one value.
* Example: sum all numbers.


### 3. **`some` vs `every`**

* **`some`**: Returns `true` if any item passes the test.


* **`every`**: Returns `true` if all items pass the test.
